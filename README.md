# Material for the ML INFN Advanced Hackathon

ML-INFN is the INFN initiative to coordinate efforts on the development and 
deployment of Machine Learning algorithms across its research lines. 
As part of our programme, we organize training events to discuss base and advanced 
Machine Learning topics with time to go through the code. We call them hackathons.

The [first](https://agenda.infn.it/event/25855/overview) and 
[second](https://agenda.infn.it/event/28565/) hackathons were targeting
machine-learning beginners. The material used for those events is available in 
[another GitHub repository](https://github.com/tommasoboccali/ml_infn_hackBase/).

The [third](https://agenda.infn.it/event/32568/) event is targeting advanced users,
and the related material is collected in this repository.

### Structure of the repository
Contents is organized per topic in different folders. 
When documentation beyond the Jupyter notebook is needed, a README.md file is 
included in the sub-directory.

#### Contents
 * `advanced_jupyter`: tricks and suggestions to get the most out of your 
    Jupyter-powered instance including remote access and pipelining multiple notebooks.
 * `introduction_to_gnns`: a gentle introduction to Graph Neural Networks using 
    synthetic data
 * `ex`: material for the hackathon exercises
   * [`unet`](./ex/unet): Lung Segmentation on Chest X-Ray images with U-Net
   * [`domain_adaptation`](./ex/domain_adaptation): Domain Adaptation for model-independent 
     training in High Energy Physics
   * [`gnn_transformers`](./ex/gnn_transformers): Introduction to Graph Neural Networks
     and Transformers with applications from High Energy Physics
   * [`xai](./ex/xai): Introduction to Explainable Artificial Intelligence algorithms
     with applications from Bioinformatics and Biogenetics


### Automated Testing
Tests on the notebooks are run frequently on the different setups being prepared
for the hackathon event.

Run all tests with:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_notebooks.py -v --durations=0
```
