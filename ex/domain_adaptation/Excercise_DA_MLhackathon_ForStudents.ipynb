    "# **Domain Adaptation to train model-independent classifiers in High Energy Physics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Machine Learning classifiers to distinguish signal from background in High Energy Physics is usually based on simulated datasets, at least for the signal component. The simulation of signal relies on theoretical models that often include hypotheses that have not been completely validated, yet. As a consequence, an implicit bias is introduced in the classifier performance that will differ from model to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain adaptation can be used to mitigate the dependence of the trained classifier on the theoretical model adopted for training, forcing the classifier Neural Network to actively ignore the information necessary to distinguish different theoretical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, which is inspired by a recently published study ([EPJC 82 (2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-10871-3), [arXiv:2207.09293](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09293)), we will implement a simplified version of the method to simulated LHC datasets, discussing the most interesting features and pitfalls of the method."

    "# Brief description of the physics use case\n",

    "We consider the physics use case of a cross section measurement at the LHC. In particular the process we are interested to measure is the Higgs boson produced through *Vector Boson Fusion* (**VBF**) and decaying to a pair of W bosons. The final state of interest is the fully leptonic one, i.e. when both W bosons decay to leptons $W^\\pm\\to\\ell^\\pm\\nu$.\n",

    "This is a rare process and the usage of Machine Learning techniques for the event classification and discrimination from backgrounds is extremely important. In this use case we consider two distinct sources of background processes: the Higgs boson production through gluon fusion and consequent decay to $WW\\to2\\ell2\\nu$ (**ggH**), and all other sources of backgrounds (**BKG**), mainly arising from $t\\bar{t}$ and non-resonant $WW$ production. Examples of the Feynman diagrams for ggH (left), $t\\bar{t}$ (center) and $WW$ (right) processes are shown below.\n",

    "We want to build a three-classes feed-forward Deep Neural Network to categorize the events in the VBF, ggH and BKG classes with the maximum achievable accuracy. At the same time, we want the output probability distributions to be independent of the particular VBF theoretical model used in the training and in the analysis."

    "In summary, comparing the 3 approaches we have seen that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ADNN performance is characterized by a low average K-S test statistic and uniform categorical accuracies for all the models.\n",
    "2. The ADNN with $\\alpha=0$ seems to perform better if we only look at the categorical accuracies, but the average KS is fairly high and if we look at the confusion matrices in detail we can observe that there is a large variation in the fraction of signal events classified as VBF depending on the signal model.\n",
    "3. The simple DNN has a fairly high accuracy if evaluated for SM events (i.e. target domain equal to the source domain), but starts to fail dramatically as soon as we evaluate it on one of the BSM models."

    "We may argue that the signal model chosen by Nature is unknown and in general different from the ones the discriminator has been trained on. This is indeed the primary reason why one wants the discriminator performance to be model independent in the first place. It is thus important to establish a procedure to evaluate the degree of model independence of the discriminator with respect to signal models unseen in the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific use case, we want to check the performance of the *ADNN* for a given model that was not seen in the training. For achieving this goal, let's retrain the *ADNN* dropping one model (say `isBSM5`) from the dataset.\n",
